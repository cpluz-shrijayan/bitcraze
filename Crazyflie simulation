->This file contains the basic steps to implement the crazyflie simulation in Gazebo.
->Currently it contains low resolution meshes based on the design of the actual [crazyflie 2.1](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/) 
  but heavily simplified to contain as little vertices as possible, so it can be used to simulate a lot of them!
  
  Step-1:
  ->$sudo snap install webots
  ->$webots webots/worlds/crazyflie_world.wbt
  
  Step-2:
  ->Go into the crazyflie_simulation/controllers/ folder
  ->sudo apt install swig
  ->swig -python pid_controller.i
  ->python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
  
  Step-3:
  ->Go the crazyflie-firmware directory
  ->make defconfig
  ->$make bindings_python
